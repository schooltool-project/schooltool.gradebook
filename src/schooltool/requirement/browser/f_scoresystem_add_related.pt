      This form allows you to create a customized "score system" or grading scale.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      A score system is made up of a sequence of possible scores with decreasing values.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Each score is associated with a numeric point value. For example, in the US, an "A" is usually worth 4 points, a "B," 3 points, etc. This value will be used in any calculations made with the scores, such as finding a grade point average.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Each score is also associated with a minimum percentage necessary to achieve the corresponding grade. For example, 95% and above is an "A," 87% and up is a "B," etc.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Enter an abbreviation for a score only if the score has more than four characters and you wish to create an alternative abbreviation for the gradebook.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Start with the highest score. Click "Add" to add scores until you have created a score with a minimum percentage of 0.
