      Course Worksheets can be be used to include sets of activities
      in the gradebooks of all sections of a course.  The activities
      included in Course Worksheets are defined in templates, shown
      here.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      The templates can be created from this page (see Add: Course
      Worksheet) or from the individual gradebook of the instructor of
      a section of this course who is either a "Responsible party" for
      the course or a member of "Clerks" or "Site Managers."
