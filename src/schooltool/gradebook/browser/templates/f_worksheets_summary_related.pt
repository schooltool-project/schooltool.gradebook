      You can add a summary worksheet to each of your gradebooks that
      automatically includes a column for the average of all existing
      worksheets.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      For example, if you have three worksheets in a section, "A,"
      "B," and "C," and click "Create Summary Worksheets," an
      additional sheet, entitled "Summary" will be created, which
      includes the average scores from "A," "B" and "C" in the first
      three columns.
