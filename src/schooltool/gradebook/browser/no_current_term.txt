===============
No Current Term
===============

If a schooltool operation relies on there being at least one term set up, and
the administator has not gotten around to doing that, we need to fail
gracefully.  That means giving the user an error message rather than crashing.

Let's log in as manager and create a student.

    >>> from schooltool.app.browser.ftests import setup
    >>> manager = Browser('manager', 'schooltool')
    >>> setup.addPerson('Student One', 'student1', 'pwd')

We'll navigate to the student and request a report card, an operation that is
impossible without there being at least one term set up.  We'll test that the
user gets redirected to the error page.

    >>> manager.getLink('Manage').click()
    >>> manager.getLink('Persons').click()
    >>> manager.getLink('Student One').click()
    >>> manager.getLink('Print Report Card').click()
    >>> manager.url
    'http://localhost/no_current_term.html'
