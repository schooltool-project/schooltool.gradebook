Report Cards
============

The end goal of having users enter grades is for parents to receive a
report card from the school after each grading period has ended.  To facilitate
this, the admin user will set up report sheet templates at the application
level, then choose on to deploy to a given term.  This deployment will
result in a special worksheet being inserted into every section for that
term so that the teachers can enter the final grades of the grading period.
Finally, the admin user will be able to request report cards to be printed
after each gradding period has ended.

Let's start by setting up the application and logging in as manager.

    >>> from schooltool.app.browser.ftests import setup
    >>> setup.setUpBasicSchool()
    >>> manager = Browser('manager', 'schooltool')

The first step is to set up the report sheet templates.  This is done from
the Manage tab.

    >>> manager.getLink('Manage').click()
    >>> manager.getLink('Report Sheet Templates').click()

We see that there are no report worksheets yet.  We'll add one.

    >>> manager.getLink('New Report Worksheet').click()
    >>> manager.getControl('Title').value = 'Test'
    >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()

Now we see that the new report worksheet appears in the list.  We'll click
on it to add a report activity to it.  We need only fill in the title as the
other required fields default to the first value in the vocabulary.

    >>> manager.getLink('Test').click()
    >>> manager.getLink('New Report Activity').click()
    >>> manager.getControl('Title').value = 'Activity 1'
    >>> manager.getControl('Add').click()
